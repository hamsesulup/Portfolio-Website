## üìù Description:
This issue aims to improve the current HTML/CSS/JS-based portfolio by:
  1. Rebuilding the website in React.js
  2. Improve modularity and reusability of components (e.g., Navbar, ProjectCard, Footer).
  3. Use React Router for navigation (if multi-page).
  4. Optional: Integrate a CMS (like Sanity/Contentful) or use static JSON for content.

Add smooth animations and transitions
  1. Use Framer Motion for modern, smooth animations.
  2. Animate on scroll using AOS or similar library.
  3. Improve button hover effects and image transitions.

`
## üéØ Goals:

Refactor the entire UI into React.js components.
Make the design more dynamic with modern animations.
Preserve current features (SEO, accessibility, responsive layout).
Keep styling consistent with the original design or improve where needed.
`
`
##üí° Suggestions:

Use TailwindCSS or SCSS for maintainable styling.
Consider improving accessibility (ARIA roles, color contrast).
Keep performance in mind (lazy loading images, code splitting).
